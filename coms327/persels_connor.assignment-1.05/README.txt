ABOUT:
    Controls are similar to assignment doc, just with a couple minor differences:
        *There is no > to enter or exit the center/mart. Once you walk into the
        same tile as the mart/center you will bring up the respective window.
        *Leaving the mart/center is just clicking Esc instead of clicking <.
    I liked this method better than walking over thhe center then clicking >.
        It was okay'd on piazza that you didn't need the > or < if you
        supplimented it with a different action

    Battles are initiated when a tile nearby the player is occupied by a non-defeated trainer.
        The only time you can walk over trainers is when they are already defeated.

BUGS:
    Occasionally, some actions like Q or esc will require pressing twice rather than once.
        I don't know why this is the case.

    In some cases when you collide with an NPC, it'll segfault instead of booting up the battle screen.
