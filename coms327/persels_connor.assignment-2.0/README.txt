ABOUT:
	This game is Minesweeper. I had an interface for selecting which tile to sweep, but
	the program would seg-fault when I attempt my recursion to reveal neighboring open spaces.

	Since this is not 100% complete to my satisfaction, I instead have the program output the gameboard in its entirety
	to prove I still knew how to do everything else aka generating an actual tile map.
	

HOW TO RUN:
		make 
	and then 
		./game
