ABOUT:

    ./poke327

    Everything required in the assignment is implemented to my knowledge.

    If you want to simulate encountering a wild pokemon instead of pacing
        through grass forever, I mapped the 'z' key to trigger an encounter
        immediately. Once the game is done this key of course would not exist.

BUGS:
    Sometimes it will segfault instead of opening the wild pokemon encounter. I don't
        really know why this is happening. I would assume it has to do with how I'm
        finding the pokemon's moves in io.cpp.

    There's a pixel or two on the wild encounter box that peeks through from the map.
