README:

KnightsTour is a C program that computes all the possible tours a knight can do on a 5x5 chess board (that is, visiting every space on the board). KnightsTour prints all of the paths the knight takes.

The file name is KnightsTour

This is done by recursively brute forcing all the possible move combinations for the knight piece.
