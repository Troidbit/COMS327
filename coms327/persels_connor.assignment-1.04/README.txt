ABOUT:
	*Displays the various trainers around the map and moves the trainers via a priority queue to the pc

NOTES:
	*Sometimes this works, sometimes nobody on the map moves.
	I didn't give myself enough time to fix the occasional trainers-not-moving-bug.

CREDIT:
	*Built off of Assignment-1.03 solution.
	*The rest is coded by myself.
